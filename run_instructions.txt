Instructions to run
1. Import as a maven project.
2. Update bootThreshold=10 in /resources/reference.conf. This means (1 Bootstrap server + 9 normal servers)
3. Run maven install.
4. Launch bootstrap server with the following command:
	java -jar target/project17-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar -p <port>
5. Launch 9 normal servers each binding to a different port. (3 groups of 3 servers). Each group represents one replication group in which one server shall be automatically designated as leader node.
	java -jar target/project17-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar -p <port> -r <key range, see below> -c <bsip>:<bsport>
	r=1 means key-range 10-19
	r=2 means key-range 20-29
	r=3 means key-range 30-39 and so on...


The bootstrap server places servers with same key range into the same group. For e.g all servers with r=1 will be placed in the same group.

6. Once the system is booted up, start the client
	java -jar target/project17-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar -p <port> -b <bsip>:<bsport>
7. on the cli, one can run the following operations
	op get:29 (Get value corresponding to key 29. All servers are hardcoded to return key*1000 as value unless the value is overwritten with a put operation)
	op put:<key>:<new value> (put operation)
	op cas:<key>:<old value>:<new value> (Compare and swap operation)
